49] NOTES To CATO MAIOR. 9⁵

Cf. Ovid‚ Met. 4, ²59 dementer ammius uti with Cic. Tusc 4, 68
venereis voluptatibus frui. —, di meliora: sc. duint ; this archaic
form usually occurs when the phrase is given in full. The story of
Sophocles is taken by Cicero from Plato (Rep. 329 u) who has
εὐφήμει. —istinc etc: cf. the passage in Plato, Rep. 1, 329 e. For
rsa· used otherwise than of place cf. unde in 12 with n. '-- agresti:
‘boorish'3 rusticus denotes simply an ordinary countrymane-
quamquam ergo: these words may be scanned as a hexameter
line, but the pause before ergo would prevent them from being taken
as averse. -hoc non desiderare: ‘this absence of regret’3 the
words form the subject of est. So hac nen dolere in Fine, 18. For
the pronoun in agreement with the infinitive treated as noun cf, Persius
1‚9 istud vivere 1, 122 hoc ridere meum, H. 538, 3.

48 si: ‘even if', ‘grauting that ’. —bona aetas: ‘the good
time of life ’‚ i.e. youth Tischerqu. Varro de Re Rustica 2,‘6, 2 mares
feminaeque bana aetate=‘ young '. For bana aetas=lzamines bona
aetate ci. n. on 26 senectm. — ut diximus: not expressly, but the
opinion is implied in 44, 45. - Turpione Ambivio: L: Ambivius
· Turpio was the most famous actor of Cato's time, and xappeared es·
pecially in Terence's plays. In old Latin commonly, occasionally in
the Latin of the best period, and often in Tacitus, the arguenter is
placed before the namen when the praenomen is not mentioned. Cf.
Att. 11, 12, 1 Balbo Cornelio. The usage is more common in Cicero’s
writings than in those of his contemporaries. —prima cavea: ‘the
lower tier '. The later Roman theatres consisted of semicircular or
elliptic galleries‚ with rising tiers of seats3 the level space partially
enclosed by the curve was the orchestra, which was bounded by the
stage in fronl. There can be little doubt that Cicero is guilty of
an anachronism here; his words do not suit the circumstances of
Cato's time. Till nea'rly the end of the Republic the theatres were
rude structores of wood, put up temporarily3 it is even doubtful
whether they contained seats for the audience. Cato himself frus·
trated an attempt to establish a permanent theatre. — propter:
‘close by’. The adverbial use of propter (rarely, if ever, met with
outside of cicero) is denied by some scholarS, but is well attested by
MSS. here and elsewhere. — tantum ... est: these words quality
delectatur. .

49. ilia: put for illud, as iu Greek ταῦτα and edic are often put
lorwim and τόδι. The words from animum to the end of the sen
